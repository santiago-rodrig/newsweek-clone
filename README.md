# Using Bootstrap
A cloning of the [Newsweek home page](https://www.newsweek.com/) using
Bootstrap. The goal is to use Bootstrap grid layout methods for positioning
the elements on the page and making this latest responsive.

## Web Technologies
HTML5 and CSS3, and Bootstrap as a CSS3 framework that helps to create the page
faster and make it responsive easily.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to Microverse and The Odin Project for pointing me to all these resources
of worth for creating web sites.
